# poisson_lbm

A small collection of 1D Poisson solvers based on the lattice Boltzmann method

## Description

This package contains an implementation of the one-dimensional Poisson solver from the paper: Chai, Z., & Shi, B. (2008). A novel lattice Boltzmann model for the Poisson equation. Applied mathematical modelling, 32(10), 2050-2058.

## Examples

Usage examples can be found in the apps folder.
In the first example we solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation with Debye-Huckel approximation $$\nabla^2 u = k^2 u$$
